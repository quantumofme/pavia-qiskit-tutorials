    "## Bits, Qubits and Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Quantum computation, similarly to its classical counterpart, is often described and discussed in terms of a circuital model. Information carriers are called <i>quantum bits</i> (<i>qubits</i> for short) and will be represented with straight lines. The flow of information is controlled by single- or multi-qubit operations known as <i>quantum gates</i> which are represented as boxes with input and output qubit wires. During the quantum computation and at the end of it, classical information, including for example the memory slots in which the results of specific operations are stored, is carried around by classical bits, represented by double straight lines. We have already seen some examples of <i>quantum circuits</i>, i.e. collections of qubits (i.e. <i>quantum registers</i>), <i>classical registers</i> of bits and operations, in the <a href=\"./Introduction.ipynb\">Introduction</a>, but we will present here their properties in greater detail. In general terms, there are three fundamental stages common to any quantum computation protocol:</p>\n",

    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> <b>processing of the information</b>, which is carried out by controlling the physical evolution of the qubits, with quantum gates corresponding to unitary transformations;</p>\n",
    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> <b>output readout</b>, which is performed by measuring (in the quantum mechanical sense) some specific properties of the qubits. Since quantum measurements are intrinsically probabilistic, the same is also true for many quantum algorithms.</p>\n",

This is known as a <i>measure in the computational basis</i>. When the state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\alpha\\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\beta\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ contains both $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ components, the outcome of a single measure is probabilistic, and the two results are observed with probabilities $p_0 = \\left|\\alpha\\right|^2$ and $p_1 = \\left|\\beta\\right|^2$. If the same circuit is repeated several times (the keyword option in qiskit is <code>shots</code>), then the statistics of outcomes can easily be reconstructed. As an example, we can add a measure to the circuit <code>qc0</code>, simulate it 1024 times and see how many times the classical bit on which we store the result is 0, given that the state on the qubit is $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ </p>"

    "The main advantage of the QFT as compared with the classical counterpart it that it can be efficiently (i.e. with a number of elementary operation polinomial in the size $n$ of the input) implemented on a quantum computer. Without going through all the details of the derivation, which you can for example find in the book by Nielsen and Chuang recommended at the beginning of the algorithms section of this notebook, we present here the general structure of a unitary circuit implementing QFT. After preparing your $N$ qubit register in the input state $\\left| j\\right\\rangle$ by applying for example suitable single qubit rotations (e.g. $\\mathrm{X}$ gates), the standard QFT algorithm contains only two types of gates, namely Hadamard single qubit rotations and controlled phase rotations $\\mathrm{CPHASE}(\\delta)$, and can be constructed using the following procedure:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i = 1 to N do:\n",
    "    apply H to qubit i in your register\n",
    "    for k = i+1 to N do:\n",
    "        l = k-i+1\n",
    "        apply CPHASE(2*pi*(1/2^l)) with qubit i as target and qubit k as control\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Final $\\mathrm{SWAP}$ gates are then needed to reverse the order of the output qubits. Here is an example code for QFT in qiskit (without the initial preparation of the input state $\\left| j\\right\\rangle$ and the final $\\mathrm{SWAP}$s), in principle valid for any $N$ and $n = 2^N$:</p>"
