Feynman, Int. J. Theor. Phys. <b>21</b>, 467). Indeed, just about fifteen years later, in 1996, Seth Lloyd proved that idea to be essentially correct (see S. Lloyd, Science <b>273</b>, 1073), with the sole limitation that the system to be simulated only carries local interactions between its constituent subsystems. In these notes, we will thus concentrate on system Hamiltonians of the form\n",

    "### Universal quantum computer as a quantum simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Given a certain Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}$, the problem of computing the corresponding time evolution operator $\\mathrm{U}(t) = \\exp\\left(-i\\mathcal{H}t\\right)$ is equivalent to the task of implementing a well defined unitary matrix. As it is well known, any quantum computer endowed with a universal set of quantum gates is in principle able to perform any arbitrary unitary transformation, albeit not necessarily in an efficient number of elementary operations. What Lloyd actually proved back in 1996 is precisely that there exist ways for universal quantum computers to compute $\\mathrm{U}(t)$ efficiently (i.e. with polynomial time and memory resources in the size of the target system) when $\\mathcal{H}$ is a sum of local terms. We will not give here a formal proof of Lloyd's theorem (if you are interested, you can have a look at the original _Science_ paper mentioned in the references), but we will provide some qualitative arguments as a guide for intuition. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> The general idea is based on two fundamental facts: first, in the circuital model for universal quantum computation we can implement general unitary transformations by successively performing elementary unitary operations (<i>quantum gates</i>), and appending one unitary $\\mathrm{U}_A$ after another $\\mathrm{U}_B$ in the circuit results in a total unitary which mathematically is the product $\\mathrm{U}_A\\mathrm{U}_B$ being applied to the state of the qubit register. Second, any unitary operation $\\mathrm{U}$ acting on $N$ qubits can be implemented with $O(2^{2N})$ elementary operations (remember that the dimension of the Hilbert space of $N$ qubits is $d=2^N$). Suppose now that we are given a Hamiltonian which is a sum of local terms\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_l^L \\mathcal{H}_l\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with, say, $L = p\\cdot N/2$, where $p$ measures a degree of <i>locality</i> (it can be, for example, the number of nearest neighbors in a lattice, which is the reason why we added a factor 2 in the definition) and $N$ is the total number of qubits required to encode the computation. In general, according to the rules above, computing directly the unitary operator $\\mathrm{U}(t) = \\exp\\left(-i\\mathcal{H}t\\right)$ requires $O(2^{2N})$ operations, and is therefore exponentially inefficient. However, let us call $m_l$ the dimension of the subsystem over which the action of $\\mathcal{H}_l$ is restricted. Typically, we will have $m_l \\ll 2^N$, since local terms only involve few-body interactions. In this case, the unitary $\\mathrm{U}_l(t) = \\exp\\left(-i\\mathcal{H}_lt\\right)$ can be computed with $O(m_l^{2})$ operations. The overall product\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\prod_l \\mathrm{U}_l(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "can therefore be obtained on a universal quantum computer by juxtaposing the circuit implementations of the single $\\mathrm{U}_l(t)$ unitaries and takes at most $O(Lm_{max}^2)$ elementary operations, where $m_{max} = \\max_l m_l$. The final step of the reasoning lies in the following mathematical identity, which is known as the Suzuki-Trotter (ST) decomposition:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{-i\\sum_l \\mathcal{H}_l t} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\prod_l e^{-i \\mathcal{H}_l t/n}\\right)^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Unless all the $\\mathcal{H}_l$ operators commute in the mathematical sense, in which case the ST identity is exact already for $n=1$, the product of local unitaries will not be exactly equal to the total target unitary $\\mathrm{U}(t) = \\exp\\left(-i\\mathcal{H}t\\right)$. However, it can be shown that $\\forall n$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{U}(t) = e^{-i\\sum_l \\mathcal{H}_l t} = \\left(\\prod_l e^{-i \\mathcal{H}_l t/n}\\right)^n + O\\left(\\frac{t^2}{n}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which means that we can approximate arbitrarily well the desired unitary operator by repeating $n$ times the sequence of gates corresponding to the product of local terms for time slices $t/n$. All in all, we were able to break our original problem into smaller pieces $e^{-i \\mathcal{H}_l t/n}$ which can now be implemented efficiently using only a limited set of elementary gates and which give the correct answer up to an arbitrarily small <i>digitalization</i> error. Indeed, for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and $t$, there exist a $n_\\epsilon$ such that $\\mathrm{U}(t)$ can be computed within an approximation $\\epsilon$ in at most $n_\\epsilon Lm_{max}^2$ operations. This is polynomial in $N$ whenever $L = \\text{poly}(N)$, as it is for example the case for nearest neighbors interactions.\n",

    "### The Suzuki-Trotter formula\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Before proceeding with more specific quantum simulations techniques and examples, let us spend a few more comments on the ST formula which constitutes the fundamental basis of all such applications. An intuitive interpretation of its working principles can be given with two examples. The first one is rather qualitative and was suggested by Lloyd himself in his original paper on quantum simulations. Imagine you want to parallel park your car between two other cars in a space that is just an $\\epsilon$ longer than what you need: the best strategy would be to place you car just next to the empty spot, parallel to the sidewalk, and then shift laterally. Unfortunately, no car can normally do such a thing, since it is bound to move only back and forth in arcs with a limited curvature, as much as the quantum computer is bound to perform products of local terms if you want your computation to be efficient. However, as everyone is told in drivng schools, you can always parallel park your car (actually, in a space which is just $\\epsilon$ longer than the car itself!) by approximating the required trajectory with many <i>small</i> arc movements. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, this is exactly what the ST formula is doing for the simulation of our target unitary transformation.  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> More quantitatively, we can show the ST formula at work in a simple case which involves 3d rotations. Indeed, it is not difficult to show that (test it yourself with any object on your desk) finite-angle rotations in space around different coordinate axes do not commute in general. Recalling that the quantum state of a qubit can be mapped into a 3-dimensional unit vector on the Bloch sphere (see <a href=\"./Part1.ipynb\">Part 1</a>), we can explore the behavior of rotations by applying elementary quantum gates. Imagine for example that we start from the north pole of the Bloch sphere (i.e. the basis state $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$) and we want to perform a rotation around the $x=z$ axis by an angle $\\theta$. The corresponding unitary operator is (for single qubit rotations, see Exercise 1.3 in <a href=\"./Part1.ipynb\">Part 1</a>):\n",

More in general, this is usually true whenever non-commuting local terms are involved.</p>\n",
    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> When working on digital quantum simulations of spin chains featuring different number of sub-systems and different chain topologies, one should notice that, as shown in the $N=3$ example above, all bonds with common ends (e.g. 1-2 and 2-3) correspond in general to non-commuting local terms in the Hamiltonian. However, all bonds with no common ends will be independent of each other and their corresponding contributions to the total Hamiltonian will commute. As a consequence, the parts of the quantum algorithm encoding for such commuting portions of the Hamiltonian, if mapped on independent set of qubits, can be executed in parallel even within a single Suzuki-Trotter step, thus resulting in a more efficient scaling of the total length of the quantum circuit. </p>\n",
    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> More refined versions of the ST decomposition are known, with sometimes better scaling properties of the digital error. An example is the so called <i>second order</i> formula\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{-i(H_1 + H_2)t} = \\left(e^{-iH_1t/(2n)}e^{-iH_2t/n}e^{-iH_1t/(2n)}\\right)^n + O\\left(\\frac{t^3}{n^2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> It may seem, from the simulations presented above, that the digitalization error is for all practical purposes just a matter of adding a <code>for</code> cycle in your quantum code. However, one should keep in mind that, especially in the age of noisy quantum processors, longer sequences mean longer execution times and heavier exposure to <i>physical</i> noise and errors on the qubits. As a matter of fact, there is today a reasonable limit in the total number of gates that can be executed on a real processor without affecting too much the quality of the final results. A careful balance between mathematical errors arising from the ST decomposition and the hardware-level errors is extremely important: while the absence of full error correction still limits the power of the processors themselves, it is nevertheless already possible to perform remarkable (and funny!) proof-of-principle quantum simulations. These could in turn become a very valuable asset whenever a next generation of processors, with a larger number of qubits even if still error-prone, will eventually show a quantum advantage in computational power with respect to all classical counterparts.\n",

    "### <i>Bonus track 1</i>: measuring the qubits in bases other than the computational basis\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> We have so far limited our quantum simulations to observables connected to the spin magnetization along the $z$ direction. This is mainly due to the fact that typical real quantum processors and quantum programming interfaces such as qiskit naturally provide qubit measurements <i>in the computational basis</i>, which is essentially the basis of eigenstates of $\\sigma_z$ for each qubit. However, it is not difficult to design a circuit allowing to observe different quantities, i.e. to measure properties of the qubits other than the projection of the Bloch state vector along the $z$ direction. In fact, it is even possible to design <i>collective</i> (or entangled) measurements on groups of qubits (see Exercise 2.8 below). Both in the case of individual qubit measurements along arbitrary directions and of collective measurements, the general procedure looks actually the same. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> As it is well known, any observable quantity $\\mathcal{O}$ in quantum mechanics has a related self-adjoint operator $O$ whose eigenstates in the mathematical sense correspond to quantum states with a definite (eigen)value for that observable. Superpositions of eigenstates give in some sense <i>average</i> values for the observable. As we have done in the quantum simulations above for the case $O = \\sigma_z$, to obtain a measure of $\\mathcal{O}$ we need to project our qubits onto the basis of $O$ eigenstates: for example, the well known measurement in the computational basis essentially asks each qubit whether its $z$ component is $0$ or $1$, prjecting its state on the basis $\\left\\{\\left|0\\right\\rangle, \\left|1\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$. Repeating the same circuit several times, we can reconstruct the average value of $\\sigma_z$ from the statistics of the outcomes. Suppose now we want to measure another observable instead, say $\\sigma_x$, but, as it is the case in qiskit, we are limited only to measurements in the computational basis $\\left\\{\\left|0\\right\\rangle, \\left|1\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$. We can easily achieve this with the following recipe: <i>prepend to the final measurement in the computational basis, after the quantum circuit representing the dynamical part of your algorithm, an additional unitary gate that maps the eigenvectors of $O$ onto the computational basis states</i>. Since any two bases in the Hilbert space of the quantum register are always connected by a unitary transformation, and any unitary transformation can be encoded as a sequence of gates, any observable quantity can in principle be measured in this way. While designing the mapping unitary, we just need to keep track of which of the eingevectors of $O$ gets mapped into which state in the computational basis in order to be able to get back to the original eigenvalue of $O$ from the binary outcome of the measurement in the computational basis. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Let us clarify this technique with an example on a single qubit case, choosing $O = \\sigma_x$. The two eigenstates are:\n",

Each time we find the outcome to be $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ or $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ (eigenvalues 0 and 1 in the computational basis, i.e. in the result bits), we then know the corresponding state along $x$ would be $\\left|+\\right\\rangle$ or $\\left|-\\right\\rangle$ (eigenvalues $\\pm 1$) respectively.

For any such $\\sigma_n$, the relevant eigenvectors are clearly related to those of $\\sigma_z$ by the geometrical rotation relating $\\vec{n}$ and the $z$ axis. Let us now call $P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})$ the average value of the product of the spins of two qubits along two directions $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) = \\langle\\sigma_a \\otimes \\sigma_b\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For arbitrary $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ it is not difficult to show that quantum mechanics predicts for the singlet Bell state $\\left|\\psi^-\\right\\rangle = 1/\\sqrt(2)(\\left|01\\right\\rangle-\\left|10\\right\\rangle)$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) = \\langle\\psi^-\\left|\\sigma_a \\otimes \\sigma_b\\right|\\psi^-\\rangle =  - \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Bell's theorem states that any local hidden variable extension of quantum mechanics must satisfy the following inequality\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) - P(\\vec{a},\\vec{c})| \\leq 1 + P(\\vec{b},\\vec{c})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for arbirary $\\vec{a},\\vec{b},\\vec{c}$. However, it can be shown that quantum mechanics violates such a bound in many cases. One of such tests is performed explicitly using qiskit in the code below, where all expectation values are computed on one of the maximally entangled Bell states and the $\\vec{a},\\vec{b},\\vec{c}$ vectors are $\\vec{b} = z\\text{ axis}$, $\\vec{c} = x\\text{ axis}$ and $\\vec{a}$ is varied in the $z$-$x$ plane.\n",

Obviously, the quantum circuit (i.e. the quantum algorithm) that we want to run must fit into the size and connectivity of the chosen device, pretty much as it is the case with, e.g., RAM hardware requirements for everyday classical software.
