# Pavia Quantum Computing, Quantum Simulations & Qiskit Tutorial - Version 1.1.0

These Jupyter notebooks were originally designed as support materials for courses in Quantum Computing and Quantum Simulations at the University of Pavia (Department of Physics).
No prior knowledge or experience in quantum computing is assumed, but standard linear algebra, basic quantum mechanics and some acquaintance with
python are required to make these tutorials more useful and interesting.

## Requirements

These notebooks were created and tested under Python 3.6.12 using the Anaconda distribution and the following modules:  
```
'qiskit-terra': '0.16.0',
'qiskit-aer': '0.7.0',
'qiskit-ignis': '0.5.0',
'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.11.0',
'qiskit-aqua': '0.8.0',
'qiskit': '0.23.0'.
'matplotlib': '3.3.2',
'numpy': '1.19.2',
'scipy': '1.5.2'
```
To use the latex-based circuit drawing tool, you will also need the `pdflatex` compiler and the Poppler library appropriate for your operating system (see the documentation of the official Qiskit tutorials for more details).
Notice that qiskit is currently under active and fast development, and it might undergo some restyling in the future. Compatibility of 
these tutorials with future releases is attempted but cannot currently be assured.

In order to have access to the cloud-based real IBM Quantum processors, you will need an account and an API key on the IBM Quantum Experience 
(https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

## Installation

In order to use these notebooks, we suggest you take the following steps.

### Anaconda distribution

Download and install the Anaconda python distribution for your operating system (e.g. from the website <https://www.anaconda.com/>).
This will automatically provide you with most scientific python libraries and the Jupyter notebook editor. For advanced users, we recommend creating
a virtual environment.

### Installing qiskit

Activate your Ananconda distribution from a terminal. In bash, this is usually done by typing
```
source activate
```
In Windows, make sure you have added the Anaconda installation to your `PATH` and use the cmd terminal instead of PowerShell. Usually, in cmd
there is no need to `source` (i.e. the above command is just `activate`). You sould also find a dedicated Anaconda prompt within 
your installation which is already activated.

After activating Anaconda (optionally, your virtual environment), you can install qiskit by typing
```
pip install qiskit
```
If you do not specify a version, the most recent release will be installed.

### Opening the notebooks in Jupyter

To read these notebooks, just do
```
cd Your/Path/To/pavia-qiskit-tutorials
```
and then
```
jupyter notebook
```
You will be redirected to the Jupyter interface via your browser and you will be able to open the notebook of your interest.

## Usage tips

Here are a few suggestions on how to use these notebooks.

### Interaction with the code 

As any Jupyter notebook, these materials contain interactive code. You are strongly encouraged to run and play with
it to get familiar both with quantum computing concepts and with the qiskit functionalities. In any of the notebooks, if you place your cursor in a cell 
containing code, you can run it by hitting `SHIFT+ENTER`. Remember that the notebooks are written in a sequential fashion, so some of the cells may depend on the successful
execution of some others above them. We suggest you run cells in `Introduction.ipynb` and `Part2.ipynb` one by one, since these notebooks contain interaction with
the IBMQ servers wich can possibly fail or take a long time. On the other hand, `Part1.ipynb` is probably best read after running all cells first.

### Known bugs

* Some commands, depending on your platform, may raise warnings from the python kernel. They disappear if you run the corresponding cell twice, but you 
can also filter them with the python  `warnings` module.
