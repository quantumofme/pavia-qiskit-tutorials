We will cover a theoretical minumum of qiskit functionalities that will be sufficient to run simple quantum circuits on classical simulators and real cloud-based quantum processors. For more extensive discussions and advanced usage, you can have a look to the official qiskit documentation and tutorials on <a href=\"https://qiskit.org\">https://qiskit.org</a>. </p>\n",

In particular, whenever your circuit contains two-qubit $\\mathrm{CX}$ gates, it is not always possible to run it on the selected backend as it stands, since the two qubits involved may not be directly connected. Qiskit is able to deal with most of these issues related to mapping an abstract circuit to the real processor in an automated way, but you should be aware that this can result in a modified version of the circuit being actually run on the chip. This modified circuit may be longer than the original one, and therefore affected by larger amounts of noise and errors, leading to worse performances. </p>\n",
